This is some Icee shit. Fresh squeezed with lemnz to have the best damn tasting code around. Its gonna be so fresh its like rockin a big icee string o' dimunz. Now that my first repo is set up, and you have read my obnoxious README, it is time to begin my journey. Any tips or help would be very much appreciated.I have great respect for the developers that put so much of their time and effort into the open-source community.
Thanks for stopping by and putting up with my slang.
